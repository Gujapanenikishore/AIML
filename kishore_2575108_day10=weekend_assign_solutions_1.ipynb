    "\n",
    ">Prorblem statement:\n",
    " The problem statement is to create the RAILWAY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM that develops a user- fiendly software  application that facilitates various functionalities related to railway ticketing and management .the system should allow users to book tickets,cancel bookings .check fares,view their bookings and display availiabale trains.\n",
    "\n",
    ">case study:\n",
    "Imagine a scenario where a railway company needs a modern  and efficient system  to handle their ticketing and management operiations.The current manual process is time - consuming ,prone to errors ,and lacks flexibility.They want to automate these processes and provide a convenent platform for their customers to book tickets,check fares ,and manage their reservaations easily.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Data Analysi part:\n",
    "\n",
    "The Data Analysi part of the RAILWAY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM involves analysing the data collected from various sources.such as customer bookings,train schedules, and fare information.This analysis helps in gaining  insights into customer prefferences,popular routes etc.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Objective:\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary objective of the Railway management system is to  streamline and automate the ticketing and management process for both the railway company and its  customers.The specific objectives include :\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Ticket booking: ALLOW users to book tickets convinently by selecting th desired train,class,and travel date .The system should validate the availability  of seats and provide a confirmation for successful bookings\n",
    "\n",
    ">Reservation cancellation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Provide users with the option  to cancel their booked tickets if requires.The should handle cancellations requests,update seat availability,and process refunds if applicable.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Fare checking:\n",
    "\n",
    "Enable users to check fares for different trains, classes, and routes before makinng a booking,The system should fetch  the fare deatails fom the database and display them accurately.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Booking History:\n",
    "\n",
    "Allow users to view their booking history.including details such as train name,depature?arrival times,class and booking status.\n",
    "\n",
    "This feature helps users keep track of their travel history.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    ">Train Availability:Provide users with an up to date list of availabaility  trains based on the selected source and destination.The system should display relevennt details like train name,departure/arrival times,and seat availability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Menu: Display a menu to users,showcasing  the available options and functionalities of the system .\n",
    ">Exit:Allow users to  exit the program gracefully when they have completed their tasks.\n",
